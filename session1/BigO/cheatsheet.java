/*
Big O sheet:

O(1) CONSTANT NO LOOPS
usually searching algorithms have log(n) if they are sorted(Binary search) (not hash maps)

O(n) Linear - for loops and while loops

O(N^2) Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to every other element two nest loops

0(n!) Factorial- you are adding a loop for every element.

O(2^n) - Exponential.
